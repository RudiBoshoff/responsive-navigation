# Free website template

Hi! I'm Rudi.

I made a free **template** for you to use to create a website that uses a responsive navigation bar with a mobile first approach.

## 1. What the **template** will look like:

The images below show the final structure of the website in desktop view and mobile view respectively. The **template** has a header consisting of a navigation bar and a main section. You should add your website body to the main section.

Desktop View:

## 2. Details about the template:

The **template** makes use of a BEM (Block__Element--Modifier) naming convention for improved readability. It can be downloaded by just pulling from the repo. I used SCSS to style the **template** using partials for improved maintainability. I also used JQuery for the functionality of the hamburger menu toggle.

### 2.1 Template layout:

The **template** makes use of a generalized modern web page where the menu logo is aligned to the top left and the menu items are aligned to the top right of the navigation bar.

### 2.2 Template functionality:

The **template** is fully responsive, meaning that it adjusts the styling of the HTML as well as the functionality of the website based on the what devise is viewing the website.

#### 2.2.1 Mobile View

In mobile view (a view port smaller than 600px) the menu logo and menu toggle will be be displayed in the navigation bar with the menu items being hidden.

Mobile View:

Upon clicking the menu toggle the menu items will be displayed vertically and the menu toggle icon will change to a close icon.

Mobile View (toggled):

Clicking the menu toggle again will revert the display back to the original contracted state and will change the menu toggle icon back to the hamburger icon.

#### 2.2.2 Desktop View

In desktop view (a view port larger than 600px) the menu logo and menu items will be be displayed in the navigation bar with the menu toggle being hidden.

## 3. How to use the **template**:

Pull from the repo and insert your own code in the main section.
